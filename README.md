# TipTac fixed for Shadowlands

Based on the [comments in the curse addon page](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tip-tac#comments) I incorporated
the changes done by the user _Architekt909_ and _Vilogity_ in this repo in order to track the changes done
to the original addon.

I also removed a commented code block in the original addon that was causing an issue with mouse anchoring in buff frames.
